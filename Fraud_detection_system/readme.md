# Fraud Detection Using PaySim Dataset

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using insights from the PaySim dataset. The workflow involves data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, deployment, and monitoring using AWS services.

## Steps Involved

1. **Ingest and Preprocess Data**  
   - Load the PaySim dataset.
   - Clean and preprocess the transaction data for model training.

2. **Train and Evaluate the Fraud Detection Model**  
   - Implement machine learning algorithms for fraud detection.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

3. **Deploy the Model on AWS**  
   - Develop a scalable API for fraud detection using AWS services.
   
4. **Monitor Fraud Detection Results**  
   - Utilize AWS analytics services to track and improve model performance.

## Deployment
- The model is deployed as an API on AWS, ensuring scalability and real-time fraud detection.

## Monitoring
- AWS analytics services, such as CloudWatch and S3 logging, are used to monitor API performance and fraud detection trends.
